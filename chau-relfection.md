* **What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

*git fetch and merge conflicts, I kept forgeting to fetch updated files before which caused some files to be deleted and now I try to make it a habit to always fetch new files.  With merge conflicts it was more of not having any real practice.  I would go on codecademy.com and alos look at serveral youtube videos to get different perspectives on the command and it helped a lot, but real practice makes a big difference.*

* **What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

*Merge clonflicts were clarified.  I guess I never realized that making edits on different branches may cause merge conflicts*

* **What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

*I asked questions about best practices and alternative methods to use git and terminal.  I learned that if I enter the first few letters of a file name and press the "tab" key, it fill auto complete the line.  I asked my guide how to prepate and work through challenges efficiently and how if there were recommendations on what resources to ultilize.*

* **What still confuses you about git?**

*Nothing in regards to the challenge, but the idea of a git reset --hard, --soft, and --mix, I think I don't fully understand the differences and how to use them to my advantage.*

* **How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

*It was not as scary as I thought it would be.  I learned a lot from my guide.  I learned shortcut commands that were useful such as the find field in sublime.  I learned that If I make a change and one branch, then checkout into another branch, that sublime will automatically know that.  My guide was extremely knowledgable.*
